# Ashley & Sarah's Reflection:
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
 We read through the entirety of the Iteration 3 interaction pattern to understand the goals. The summary at the bottom was essential in helping us understand where to begin. Then we walked through each section (Main Menu, computer ship placement, player ship placement, etc). We started by building out the comptuer and player classes, then approached the computer placement of ships. Once we had worked out a method for randomly placing the computer's ships, there was a lot of testing to ensure that the random placement was valid. Once we had that sorted, we created player ship placement, a turn method, fire upon methods, and method to determine a winner. Additionally we added in terminal voice reading and ASCII art to make it a more dynamic game!

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
 We'd look into interation 4 and start to build that out on a branch. Figuring out how to make it an intelligent computer for picking coordinates would be super cool! 

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
 We mostly worked together over zoom using the drive/navigate method. There were some times where one partner would work async at night or in the morning and review the other partner's code and merge. But we enjoyed working together on it as it gave us both a chance to learn from each other and solve the problems using both of our perspectives. 

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
-Comments on pull requests
-Slack messages to provide updates or thoughts
-Meeting every day to tackle the project naturally brought out comments and feedback in the moment.
